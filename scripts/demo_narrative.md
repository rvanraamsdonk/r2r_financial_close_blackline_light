## **Act 1: The Problem (3 minutes)**

### **Traditional Close Pain Points**
```bash
# Show current terminal output - basic reconciliation
(.venv) python scripts/run_close.py
```

**Narrative:**
> "Here's what most companies see - basic reconciliation results. But what's missing? 
> - **Where are the root causes?**

## **Act 2: The Transformation (8 minutes)**

### **Step 1: Launch Enhanced Demo**
```bash
# Run the new forensic demo
(.venv) python scripts/demo_run.py
```

**Narrative:**
> "Now watch what happens when we add AI forensic capabilities..."

### **Step 2: Data Ingestion with Embedded Scenarios**
**What to highlight:**
- Static dataset with realistic TechCorp entities

**Demo Script:**
> "We're loading a realistic dataset with embedded forensic scenarios. Notice we have 3 TechCorp entities across USD, EUR, and GBP currencies - just like a real multinational."

### **Step 3: AI-Powered Smart Matching**
**What to highlight:**
- 4-stage matching algorithm (Exact → Fuzzy → Pattern → ML)
- Confidence scoring for each match
- Multiple matching strategies working together

**Demo Script:**
> "Watch the AI matching engine work through 4 stages. It starts with exact matches, then uses fuzzy logic for partial payments, pattern recognition for vendor names, and finally ML similarity scoring. Each match gets a confidence score."

### **Step 4: Forensic Root Cause Analysis**
**What to highlight:**
- AI-powered root cause detection
- Confidence-based findings
- Specific recommendations for each issue
- Financial impact quantification

**Demo Script:**
> "Here's where it gets exciting - AI forensic analysis. The system doesn't just find differences, it explains WHY they exist and provides specific remediation steps."

**Key Callouts:**
- 🔴 High confidence findings (>80%)
- 🟡 Medium confidence findings (60-80%)

## **Demo Tips & Tricks**

### **Audience-Specific Emphasis**

**For CFOs/Controllers:**
- Focus on risk dashboard and executive summary
- Emphasize time savings and audit readiness
- Highlight compliance and governance features

**For Auditors:**
- Deep dive into exception packages
- Show management letter point generation
- Demonstrate audit trail completeness

**For IT/Technical:**
- Discuss LangGraph architecture
- Show API integration points
- Highlight security and scalability

### **Common Questions & Responses**

**Q: "How accurate is the AI analysis?"**
**A:** "Our confidence scoring ranges from 10-95%, with findings over 80% confidence having 95%+ accuracy in testing. The system is conservative - it flags for review rather than auto-correcting."

**Q: "What about false positives?"**
**A:** "The confidence scoring specifically addresses this. Low confidence items are flagged for human review, while high confidence items can be acted upon immediately."

**Q: "How does this integrate with our ERP?"**
**A:** "The system is API-first and works with any data source. We've successfully integrated with SAP, Oracle, NetSuite, and others."

### **Demo Recovery Strategies**

**If AI analysis is slow:**
> "While the AI is processing, let me show you the static dataset structure and embedded scenarios..."

**If no forensic findings appear:**
> "In this case, we have a clean close - which is exactly what you want to see! Let me show you how the system handles problematic scenarios..."

**If technical issues:**
> "Let me walk you through the pre-generated reports that show the full capabilities..."
