New client meetings resulted in 2 signed contracts worth $95K. | **Accept variance** - strong ROI justifies overspend. Consider increasing Q3 travel budget for next year. |
| ENT101 | Professional Fees | $28,500 | $25,000 | $3,500 | 14.0% | **Primary Driver**: M&A legal fees for acquisition due diligence ($2.8K). **Secondary**: Employment law consultation ($700). **Timing**: 90% of overage in final 2 weeks of month. **Context**: Unplanned acquisition opportunity. | **Strategic**: Legal spend directly supports $2M acquisition target. Employment issue resolved without litigation risk. | **Accept variance** - strategic investment. Establish separate M&A legal budget line for future deals. |
| ENT102 | Marketing | $18,750 | $22,000 | ($3,250) | -14.8% | **Primary Driver**: Digital campaign delayed from August to September due to creative review cycle. **Secondary**: Trade publication ad cancelled ($800). **Opportunity**: Vendor offered 15% discount for Q4 commitment. | **Mixed**: Campaign delay may impact Q3 lead generation. However, Q4 discount creates cost savings opportunity. | **Monitor impact** - track Q3 lead metrics. Consider accelerating Q4 campaign to capture discount. |
