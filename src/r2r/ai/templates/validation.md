## Exception Counts by Category
{{ counts | tojson }}

## Exception Categories and Financial Totals
Categories: {{ categories | tojson }}
Totals: {{ totals | tojson }}

## Instructions
1. Analyze exception categories to identify the most critical data quality and process issues
2. Focus on categories with high counts or significant dollar amounts
3. Provide root cause analysis for material exceptions (>$50K or >10 items)
4. Recommend specific remediation actions prioritized by business impact
5. Consider cumulative risk across all exception categories
6. Use confidence scoring (0.1-1.0) based on exception patterns and materiality
