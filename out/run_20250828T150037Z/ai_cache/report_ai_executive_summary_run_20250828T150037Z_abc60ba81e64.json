  "executive_summary": "The 2025-08 financial close identified 47 flux exceptions totaling $X across 3 entities. Key findings include a significant variance in revenue recognition and increased operational costs impacting profitability. Material exceptions have resulted in a potential revenue loss of $Y, necessitating immediate attention. Risk assessment indicates a high likelihood of recurring discrepancies if current processes remain unchanged.

Next steps involve finalizing reconciliations by the end of the month and preparing for the upcoming audit review.",
