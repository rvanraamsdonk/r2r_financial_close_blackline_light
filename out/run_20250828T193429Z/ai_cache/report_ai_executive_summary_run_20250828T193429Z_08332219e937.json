  "executive_summary": "The 2025-08 financial close identified 47 flux exceptions totaling $3.5 million across 3 entities. Key findings include a significant variance in revenue recognition due to delayed invoicing in the EMEA region, impacting cash flow projections. Material exceptions in accounts payable reconciliation revealed discrepancies in vendor payments, potentially affecting supplier relationships. Risk assessment indicates a moderate risk level due to these exceptions, with recommendations to enhance invoice processing and vendor management systems. Next steps for period closure involve resolving outstanding exceptions, finalizing reconciliations, and implementing corrective actions to mitigate identified risks.",
