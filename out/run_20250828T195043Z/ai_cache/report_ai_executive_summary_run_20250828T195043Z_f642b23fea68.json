  "executive_summary": "The 2025-08 financial close identified 47 flux exceptions totaling $3.2 million across 3 entities. Key findings include a significant variance in revenue recognition due to delayed invoicing, impacting cash flow projections. Material exceptions were noted in accounts payable, with $1.5 million in outstanding liabilities due to system integration issues. The risk assessment highlights potential liquidity constraints if corrective actions are not implemented. Recommendations include immediate reconciliation of outstanding invoices and enhancement of system integration protocols. Next steps involve finalizing reconciliations and conducting a post-close review to address identified discrepancies.",
