  "executive_summary": "The 2025-08 financial close identified 47 flux exceptions totaling $3.5 million across 3 entities. Key findings include a significant variance in revenue recognition due to delayed invoicing, impacting cash flow projections. Material exceptions were noted in the accounts receivable reconciliation, primarily due to timing discrepancies in payment processing. The business impact includes potential liquidity constraints and inaccuracies in financial forecasting. Risk assessment indicates a medium risk level, with recommendations to enhance invoice processing efficiency and implement stricter reconciliation protocols. Next steps for period closure involve resolving outstanding reconciliation items and conducting a detailed review of revenue recognition policies.",
